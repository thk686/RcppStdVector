The ```std::vector``` container is the cornerstone of the C++ Standard Library. When used with Rcpp however, there is an inherent cost in using ```std::vector``` as memory must be copied both from and to R internal data structures. The RcppStdVector package allows users to write Rcpp code using the Standard Library ```std::vector``` container without incurring an extra container copy operation. Consider the following:
```
std::vector<double> my_func(std::vector<double>& x) { // copy from REALSXP to std::vector here
  ...
  return x; // additional copy from std::vector to REALSXP here
}
```
For large vectors, this entails a large overhead. Rcpp native vectors avoid these copies by holding an ```SEXP```, which will be only copied on demand. Recall however that unless an Rcpp vector is duplicated, functions can modify the vector in-place, which violates the no-side-effects rule. This can be useful or problematic in cases where the ```SEXP``` is aliased to several R variables. Most modifying Rcpp functions will therefore usually implement cloning the input vector. Similarly, using RcppStdVector, we can write:
```
SEXP my_func(RcppStdVector::std_vec_real& x) { // copy here from REALSXP to std::vector
  ...
  return Rcpp::wrap(x); // zero-overhead, no-copy return of REALSXP
}
```
The zero-overhead return is achieved by using a custom allocator that allocates an R vector instead of general heap memory. This R vector is simply retrieved from the allocator at the end. Special consideration is taken when the capacity of the ```std::vector``` is greater than its size so that there are no dangling elements. It may furthermore be possible to implement in-place operations using C++ placement new although this has not been explored.

There are several reasons one might wish to use ```std::vector``` over the native Rcpp vector types. First, as part of the Standard Library, ```std::vector``` is simple and well-documented. Compare [this](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) to [this](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/html/classRcpp_1_1Vector.html). Second, using ```std::vector``` everywhere minimizes code rewrites when moving between other C++ codebases and Rcpp.  Third, ```std::vector``` supports amortized-constant appending elements. This is a very common idiom in C++ coding and its absense in Rcpp is a source of frustration. Consider the following functions:
```
SEXP test_copy_chr(Rcpp::CharacterVector& x) { // no copy
  RcppStdVector::std_vec_chr y;     // this IS a std::vector
  auto oi = std::back_inserter(y); // amortized-constant insertion
  std::copy(x.begin(), x.end(), oi);
  return Rcpp::wrap(y);  // no copy
}

SEXP test_copy_rcpp_chr(Rcpp::CharacterVector& x) { // no copy
  Rcpp::CharacterVector y;    // Rcpp type
  auto oi = std::back_inserter(y); // copies entire vector on each insertion
  std::copy(x.begin(), x.end(), oi);
  return Rcpp::wrap(y); // no copy
}
```
On my system, I get:
```
> microbenchmark(r1 <- test_copy_chr(x), r2 <- test_copy_rcpp_chr(x))
Unit: microseconds
                        expr        min         lq         mean      median           uq         max
      r1 <- test_copy_chr(x)     94.811    102.117     124.4515    125.6335     129.7775     218.154
 r2 <- test_copy_rcpp_chr(x) 935634.546 975367.489 1012093.6482 996092.4005 1023481.6770 1228233.548
```
where ```x``` contains 1e4 character strings. The sole drawback of this idiom is that up to 50% of the memory allocated to the ```std::vector``` may be unused.

RcppStdVector supports list and string-list types. For example the following copies a list of elements and duplicates each.
```
template <int RTYPE>
void dup_vec(SEXP& s) {
  auto y = Rcpp::as<RcppStdVector::std_vec_t<RTYPE>>(s);
  auto oi = std::back_inserter(y);
  y.reserve(2 * y.size());
  std::copy(RcppStdVector::begin<RTYPE>(s),
            RcppStdVector::end<RTYPE>(s), oi);
  s = PROTECT(Rcpp::wrap(y));
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP test_double_it(RcppStdVector::std_vec_sxp& x) {
  for (auto s = x.begin(); s != x.end(); ++s) {
    switch(TYPEOF(*s)) {
    case REALSXP: dup_vec<REALSXP>(*s); break;
    case INTSXP:   dup_vec<INTSXP>(*s); break;
    case LGLSXP:   dup_vec<LGLSXP>(*s); break;
    case STRSXP:   dup_vec<STRSXP>(*s); break;
    case VECSXP:   dup_vec<VECSXP>(*s); break;
    default: Rcpp::stop("Unsupported type");
    }
  }
  UNPROTECT(x.size());
  return Rcpp::wrap(x);
}
```
I get the following:
```
> test_double_it(list(1:3, letters[1:3], (1:3) > 2, pi))
[[1]]
[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3

[[2]]
[1] "a" "b" "c" "a" "b" "c"

[[3]]
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 3.141593 3.141593
```
